We'd like to take advantage of Throwback Thursday to talk about and remember Shrek, a renegade sheep who hid in a New Zealand cave for six years and avoided sheering, until he eventually was found in April 2004. As several media outlets have reported, when Shrek was eventually sheered, he produced enough wool to create 20 large men's suits - approximately 60 pounds! The event was televised and eventually his wool was auctioned off, with proceeds donated to children's medical charities, The Dodo reported. While most sheep only live to about six years of age, Shrek lived until the age of 17, when he was euthanized after illness in 2011. We'd say he had a pretty good life Perhaps Shrek met a canine friend during his time in the wild like the one in the video below?	0
You might be asking yourself, "how can this possibly be real?" and you are not alone. The creature in the video above certainly looks like some bizarre mutation or unnatural hybrid, but the truth is that it's a totally normal and natural insect known as the mantidfly. Mantidflies look like mantises, and this particular species has coloration that mimics a wasp, but in reality it's neither a mantis or a wasp, but belongs to a different order of insects called Neuroptera and is related to lacewings, antlions and dobsonflies. They are carnivorous and feed on other insects, but luckily their coloration is just a ruse and they don't sting or even bite (people, at least).So if you see one, sit back and enjoy the wonders of that the natural world produces.	0
